### How to use

* Go to `HKEdit->Open Level`
* Open the levelxxx file in hollow_knight_Data
* Edit the scene
* Go to `HKEdit->Save Level`
* In the Hollow Knight root dir, if HKWEDiffs folder does not exist, create it and save it in that folder with the same name as the level you opened
* Delete the other generated files (HKWEDiffs, HKWEDiffs.manifest, levelxxx.manifest)
* Make sure the mod is installed and start the game. The level is automatically patched when loaded
